# Azure-412345: Azure Self-Managed AD DS & Django POC

This projectâ€™s goal is to deploy a self-managed Windows Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) domain (single domain controller) in Azure and configure a Django application to authenticate users against that domain via LDAPS. Infrastructure provisioning and in-guest configuration will be scripted as code for repeatable, push-button deployments.

## Roadmap

Future updates will cover:
- Tool selection rationale and comparisons
- Detailed implementation walkthroughs and configuration examples
- Secrets management and security best practices
- Monitoring, cost estimation, and scaling considerations
