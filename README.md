# Azure-412345: Azure Self-Managed AD DS & Django POC

This project’s goal is to deploy a self-managed Windows Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) domain (single domain controller) in Azure and configure a Django application to authenticate users against that domain via LDAPS. Everything—both infrastructure provisioning and in-guest configuration will be scripted as code for repeatable, push-button deployments.
